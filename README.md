# My Movie's Watchlist

## Overview

This app uses an external API to generate movie's information after the user searchs by movie title.  
The user can then save movie to his/her own browser local storage. The local storage gets rendered in the watchlist page.  

##Features
* The page is responsive
* After adding or removing movies to/from watchlist the user gets a message.

## Next steps

* Provide dark mode
* Set last search to Session storage so the user can go back to the search page and still see last results
* Add movie's watchlist to a external database like Firebase
